This folder includes Python and C++ programs that I have written as University tasks.
All of the programs are the largest coding tasks that I have had to make.

Laivanupotus.py, Project kaveriverkko.py, ProjectHirsipuupeli.py are tasks written with Python.
The rest of the programs in this folder are written in C++ and each one is split into multiple files so classes are used effectively.
